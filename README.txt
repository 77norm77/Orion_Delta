The ORION Delta 3D Printer by SeeMeCNC

Open-Source Files are published here on github, free to use/modify/share as you like.  We hope that some part of this design will inspire you to build and create new things!  If it does, please share your ideas/designs/concepts either through github here, or on

Firmware used is a fork of repeater-firmware, and is kept in this github repo and maintained to be a direct drop-in for all pre-assembled ORION machines.  

The ORION Delta 3D Printer is a new delta-platform machine developed by SeeMeCNC.  Designed to be more compact than the Rostock MAX, more portable and more rigid. 

The ORION is a derivative stemming from our original Rostock MAX, which is a derivative of Johann's Rostock "original".  While there are many new delta designs, the ORION is built on solid, proven history, including many changes and design enhancements from both the community, as well as observations from running multiple delta machines for thousands of hours.  

All plastic parts are injection molded, with the exception of the EZ Fan shroud, which is printed on the machine as a first test-print, then attached to the next machine being assembled :)  All CNC machined parts are made from either Aluminum, Brass or PEEK (the hot end insulator).  Lasercut parts are produced from 1/4" Melamine laminated, which is comprised of an MDF core with high temp, high pressure melamine laminate on both surfaces.  This provides a light weight, yet rigid framework that is far more stable than a plywood material to moisture, pressure, temperature etcâ€¦
